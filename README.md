# Automatic-modulation-classification-by-decision-tree-based-on-features-extraction

In non-cooperative communication scenarios, automatic modulation classification (AMC) is the premise of information acquisition. It has been a difficult issue for decades due to attenuation and interference during wireless transmission. In this project, 8 features of modulation signals based on its instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency. couple thresholds and the sequence of decision trees are set to classify the signals.
